# Negative-Weight-Shortest-Path

C++ implementation of a negative SSSP algorithm based on the papers
- [BNW algorithm](https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.03456),
- [BCF algorithm](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.05279).


Find few instructions in scripts/HOWTO.md

Run one between `build.sh`, `build_reldeb.sh`, and `build_debug.sh` to
build the executable. You will find it inside the `build` directory.
